    # 1. Download and install Python (Ensure that you add the directory path).
    # 2. Download and install your integrated development environment (IDE).
    # 3. Create a new project folder.
    # 4. Create a new Python file in your IDE.
    # 5. Add a print command that prints "Hello World" to the console to test the IDE.

    # 7. If it did not work then try again.
